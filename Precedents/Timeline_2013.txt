As we look to the future there are major challenges facing our world: 
• increasing populations 
• threats to food security 
• the impact of climate change and resultant extensions in the range of 
zoonotic diseases, ecosystem damage and loss of biodiversity 
These provide great opportunities for our profession to contribute to 
making our world a better place for human and animal populations and the 
environment in which we live. 
The veterinary profession is diverse and will continue to evolve into new areas 
of endeavour as we face the new challenges of the 21st century and beyond.
